#### L-Systems
This project is created using an L-system, which incorporates saving, loading, and randomness. The L-system is able to move in all three dimensions.

#### Instanced rendering
This project uses instanced rendering to render multiple instances of a single object. The project is created using only two primitives, not including the square base.

#### Procedural background
The background is created using fractal brownian motion of perlin noise.

#### GUI Elements
The user can modify three attributes of the L-system: iterations, size, and rotation. Iterations modifies how much the L-system expands. Size is a limit on the size of the tree. Rotation modifies how much the branches rotate.
